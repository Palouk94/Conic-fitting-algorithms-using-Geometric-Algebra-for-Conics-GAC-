# Conic-fitting-algorithms-using-Geometric-Algebra-for-Conics-GAC-

-Algorithm Q fits a general conic Q  
-Algorithm QAL fits an axes-aligned conic Q^al  
-Algorithms Q0, QO-dir & Q0-sym fit an origin-centred conic Q^0  
-Algorithms Q0, QO-dir & Q0-sym fit an axes-aligned origin-centred conic Q^al0  

All the algorithms have the same inputs and outputs:  
Inputs:  
  px, py...row vectors of x or y coordinates of data points, respectively  
Outputs:
  Q...conic vector in terms of GAC
  Conic...implicit equation of conic Q
  obj_function...minimised objective function of teh conic fitting problem
